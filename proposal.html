            <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you are at a party or a social gathering with music blasting on the speakers. 
                <em>Oh! You thought. I love this artist! Let me see if I can queue my favorite 
                song from them.</em> You look around for the host who has control (the aux) of the music... 
                But you can’t find them.
                </br>
                </br>
                <em>I wish I could queue songs without needing to find the host.</em>
                </br>
                </br>
                Almost all audio output methods only accept one input device whether it be based on aux or bluetooth. Therefore, in all circumstances where a group of people are listening to music, there will be only one person controlling what music is being played. This puts a lot of pressure on the person who is playing the music to find songs that everyone likes. There is also an accessibility issue in these scenarios: there are various different devices that host Spotify, all of which connect to audio output devices in different ways. This means that some people may not have music that they like played in a group scenario because their phone output method is incompatible with the audio input method.

            <h2>Existing Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Spotify has a <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/group-session/">built-in group session</a>
                feature currently in beta. The functionality, however, is slightly different: instead of allowing
                multiple users to add to a single queue, it allows all users to sync their players with one another,
                allowing simultaneous playback. The system we're designing works at a track-level, while the system
                Spotify has works at a player-level.

        <!-- App Description -->
        <section>
            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <h3>Intended Users</h3>
            <p>
                The target users for this web application are any group of people who listen to music in a group setting, this can range anywhere from two friends listening to music in a car to two thousand people listening to music at a club. The only limiting factor for our users is that they need to have Spotify installed on the device that they are using.
            </p>
            <h3>What the Users Will See</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The current song (sourced from the host's device using <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify's API</a>)</li>
                <li>The queue list (Sourced from the database)</li>
                <li>The session name and ID (this will be achieved by querying the database for the session ID which will have a name associated with it. While the current session ID will be stored locally)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functionality</h3>
            <img class="chart" src="img/flowchart.png" alt="App functionality flowchart">
            <p>
                Users can search for a song from all of the songs available on Spotify and add the chosen song(s) to a group queue. The queue will then automatically order the songs according to the users’ chosen settings and send the play requests to Spotify in that order. Additionally, Users can check/uncheck boxes next to the songs in a playlist to opt in and out of listening to that song. This way, as long as a user is listening to the playlist, the app will only pick from songs that that user has opted into.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
                This app will allow the users to easily and efficiently create crowd-sourced queues and collaborative/personalized playlists that can be viewed and edited from each user’s device individually. This way, no one person has the pressure to play songs that everyone likes and all listeners can control the music on their own devices.
